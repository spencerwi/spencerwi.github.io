		<section id="about_me">
			<h2>I'm a software developer living in the Atlanta, Georgia, USA area.</h2>
			<p>
				I'm into stuff like programming (for fun as well as professionally), 
				Christian theology, poetry, playing the mandolin and other guitar-family 
				instruments, occasionally dabbling in both biking and papermaking (not 
				at the same time), and an ongoing fascination with ways of making 
				written communication effective.
			</p>
			<p id="links">
				You can generally find me in the following places:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/spencerwi">Github</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/spencerwi">LinkedIn</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://spencerwi.tumblr.com">My cobweb-covered and mostly-abandoned blog</a>
					<li>
						Or basically anywhere else with the username "spencerwi" or "spencer_wi" that has a profile picture that looks like me.
					</li>
